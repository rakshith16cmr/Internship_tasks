# Python Internship Project
This repository contains 8 basic Python programs created as part of my internship. 

# Programs:
1. Sum of Two Numbers
2. Odd or Even
3. Factorial
4. Fibonacci Sequence
5. Reverse a String
6. Palindrome Check
7. Leap Year Check
8. Armstrong Number

These mini projects helped me understand how loops, conditionals, and string manipulation work in Python. There were a few bugs and logic errors along the way, but debugging them helped me Learn. Now, I'm more confident in writing and explaining simple Python code.
